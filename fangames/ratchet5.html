was a promising 2D spyro game created by youtube let's player Ratchet5,
which featured many worlds. However it was never finished and the game
isn't being worked on to my knowledge but perhaps some day we can see
it complete.<br>
            <br>There is no playable demo for this
game, but the parody prototype Dazzy the Dragon can be played. Dazzy
the Dragon parodies Reddevildazzy2007 an old controversial youtuber in
the Spyro community (See cheese slice dazzy) however that game does not
reflect the final version. I have backed up a copy from the now defunct
yoyo games sandbox server if you wish to download it. You can watch the
old development videos on Ratchet5's 2nd channel.<br>
