![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fangameimages/updates.png)

Heloooo, everyone!

Welcome to the grand opening of Spyro Fanworks!! This aims to be a site which brings all the fan created content for the original Spyro series together. Including fangames, hacks, tools, texture hacks and more to come in the future. Throughout the day I've been updating the site with as much content as I can and there's still more to be added. This is a complete list of what I have added so far...

This 3D Spyro project has a lot of potential. In it's current state there are a few problems such as the controls, and it's hard to navigate environments, however it's early days and the creator seems committed to fixing these problems! <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/goldtime.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        This fangame was created by me back when nobody else had attempted to make a 3D Spyro game. I was making it with very little experience with unity so as a result the development did not go very smoothly. Currently progress is on hiatus and plan to go back to developing the game from scratch in the future. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/fangames/eclipse.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        This was a promising 2D spyro game created by youtube let's player Ratchet5, which featured many worlds. However it was never finished and the game isn't being worked on to my knowledge but perhaps some day we can see it complete. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/fangames/ratchet5.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        I'm including two Spyro fangames in one here since they came together in a video and there's no point creating separate pages for them since they are just one level tests. These are some of the earliest examples of Spyro fangames created in 2009. I can't find an earlier example. Despite being old, these are really solid examples of fan games and could definitely be used as a basis for a really good game. Ratchet5's game may be based on the engine of the 2nd game. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/fangames/rubberrabbit.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        This is currently the best 2D Spyro game that has amazing design and really feels spyro-ey despite being 2D. So far, there is  5 levels, consisting of one hub, three levels and a boss level.  There are a total of 500 Gems to collect as well as 10 Orbs. At least 5 of these orbs are needed to access the boss fight via the golden whirlwind at then end of the hub world. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/fangames/waffled.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        Wow this one is crazy. This project is trying to look just like a ps1 game and damn it works. It looks and plays so similar that many would not be able to tell the difference. In addition the game includes a few effects not possible on a ps1 which gives it a nice touch. I really look forward to see how this game turns out. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/fangames/springsavannah.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>

        Not really a mod or a hack but I need to put this somewhere since it's too good not to. LXShadow somehow get's his hands on a copy of the Spyro The Dragon beta and provides a whole playthrough of it. Sadly a beta hasn't been leaked to the publics hands but at least we get this. You'll see so many diffrences to the finished game, such an interesting watch. Go watch this now. <a href="http://www.spyrofanworks.com/hacks-and-mods.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PAGE</a>
